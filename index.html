          <h3>Customer Service</h3>
          <p>My years at Ulta Beauty and my most recent jobs working with autistic students and with the veteran community have given me extensive experience with different characters while working in retail and customer service. Of all the jobs I’ve held before, I enjoyed my time in customer service the most. I’ve learned that I am a people person. I’ve had the chance to get to know people from all walks of life, to learn how they think and understand the world and I believe I’ve learned how I can best help anyone I encounter.</p>

          <h3>Working With Children</h3>
          <p>My previous internships and job positions also placed me in the school system and provided me with amazing lessons and opportunities working with students of varying ages and needs. I am a quick learner and able to adapt to unexpected obstacles that may occur. During my time at Sycamore Elementary, I worked with young children that had various types of issues from behavioral to academic. Many times, I have had to resolve conflicts and take over classrooms for teachers who had to step out. Working with older students at Hurst Junior High as an intern with Communities in Schools gave me a good look into what struggles young people are going through and the chance to connect them with the community resources around them. </p>
